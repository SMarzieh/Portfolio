    <h2>Hi, I’m Marzie Hosseini</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Data Analyst who became fascinated with the potential of technology and data in solving real-world problems. This led me to explore new avenues that allowed me to make a tangible difference. Data science captivated me due to its significant influence, from solving complex business problems to aiding the healthcare sector in reducing mortality through early diagnosis.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, Google Health's AI for Breast Cancer Screening has demonstrated how machine learning can detect breast cancer earlier than traditional methods, significantly improving survival rates. AI systems like these are transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases, showcasing the immense value of data science in saving lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s why I am passionate about being part of this field. My goal is to apply the analytical and research skills I gained in academia to solve real-world problems more efficiently and impactfully. I continuously refine my skills by working on challenging projects that foster both technical growth and creative thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a background in astrophysics, over two years of experience as a Power BI Developer, and more than three years of Python experience, I specialize in transforming complex data sets into actionable insights using Python and Power BI. I excel at integrating scientific rigor with creative design to develop reports and digital products.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am working as a Data Analyst in Berlin while deepening my expertise in data science through various projects. Eager to advance my career in data science and machine learning, I am open to remote opportunities that foster growth in these areas. Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, hiking, and exploring nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Known for my problem-solving skills and attention to detail, I thrive in high-pressure environments and am passionate about data visualization and storytelling.
