        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>.Introduction
I’m Marzie Hosseini, an ex-astrophysicist turned data scientist. At one point in my career, I realized I wanted a more meaningful path, and that’s when I made the decision to transition into data science. I found this field fascinating because of the impact it can have on the world, from solving complex business problems to helping the healthcare sector reduce mortality by enabling early diagnosis.

For example, Google Health's AI for Breast Cancer Screening has shown how machine learning can detect breast cancer earlier than traditional methods, significantly improving survival rates. By reducing both false positives and false negatives, AI systems like these are transforming the way we diagnose and treat diseases, proving the immense value of data science in saving lives.

That’s why I’m passionate about being part of this field. My goal is to use the analytical and research skills I gained in academia to address real-world problems in a more efficient and impactful way. I am continually refining my skills, working on projects that challenge me to grow both technically and creatively.

Currently, I’m working as a Data Analyst in Berlin while also deepening my expertise in data science through various projects. I’m excited to continue evolving in this field and contribute to making a difference.
