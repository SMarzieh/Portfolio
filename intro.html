                    <h2>Hi, I’m Marzie Hosseini</h2>
                    <p>
                        An ex-astrophysicist turned data scientist. At one point in my previous career, I became fascinated with the potential of technology and data in solving real-world problems. This led me to explore new avenues that allowed me to make a tangible difference. I found data science fascinating in terms of the influence and impact it has on our world, from solving complex business problems to helping the healthcare sector reduce mortality through early diagnosis.

                    <p>
                        For example, Google Health's AI for Breast Cancer Screening has demonstrated how machine learning can detect breast cancer earlier than traditional methods, significantly improving survival rates. AI systems like these are transforming how we diagnose and treat diseases, highlighting the immense value of data science in saving lives.

                    <p>
                        That’s why I am passionate about being part of this field. My goal is to use the analytical and research skills I gained in academia to address real-world problems more efficiently and impactfully. I am continually refining my skills, working on projects that challenge me to grow both technically and creatively.

                    <p>
                        Currently, I’m working as a Data Analyst in Berlin while also deepening my expertise in data science through various projects. I’m excited to continue evolving in this field and contribute to making a difference.
